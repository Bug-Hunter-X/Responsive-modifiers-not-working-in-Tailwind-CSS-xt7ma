# Responsive Modifiers Not Working in Tailwind CSS

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in Tailwind CSS where the responsive modifiers (e.g., `md:`, `lg:`) are not working correctly.  The styles are applied to all screen sizes, regardless of the specified breakpoint.

## Bug Description

The expected behavior is that styles with responsive modifiers should only be applied at or above the specified breakpoint. However, in this case, the styles are applied regardless of the screen size.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm start`.
4. Observe that the styles are applied to all screen sizes, even those below the specified breakpoint.

## Solution
